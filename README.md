## Hi there 👋
I'm Jess! 
I've recently comepleted _nology's 12 week intensive software development course. You can view my [portfolio here](https://xjessd.github.io/).

🌱 I’m currently learning testing automation using Testng and Selenium!

❤️ I really enjoy HTML & CSS. And I might be a bit Android biased (hence my [FakeOS](https://xjessd.github.io/fakeOS/) project).

💬 Ask me about some anime and manga 📖

📨 You can contact me on [LinkedIn here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xjessd/).
