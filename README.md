## Hi there üëã
I'm Jess! 
I've recently completed _nology's 12 week intensive software development course. You can view my [portfolio here](https://xjessd.github.io/).

üå± I‚Äôm currently learning testing automation using Testng, [Selenium](https://github.com/xJessD/test-automation-practice) and the [Cucumber framework](https://github.com/xJessD/selenium-cucumber)!

‚ù§Ô∏è I really enjoy HTML & CSS. And I might be a bit Android biased (hence my [FakeOS](https://xjessd.github.io/fakeOS/) project).

üí¨ Ask me about some anime and manga üìñ

üì® You can contact me on [LinkedIn here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xjessd/).
