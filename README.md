## Hi there 👋
I'm Jess! 

💻 I've completed my Diploma of IT (Accelerated) at UTS College with a 6.1 / 7 GPA in 2024 and am currently in my 2nd Year of a Bachelor of Computing Science at UTS with major in Enterprise System Development. 

🌱 You can view an old [portfolio here](https://xjessd.github.io/), that was created when completing  _nology's 12 week intensive software development course.

📱 Android is my preferred mobile OS hence my [FakeOS](https://xjessd.github.io/fakeOS/) project.

💬 Ask me about some anime and manga 📖

📨 You can contact me on [LinkedIn here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xjessd/).

## Hi there 👋
I'm Jess! 
I've recently completed _nology's 12 week intensive software development course. You can view my [portfolio here](https://xjessd.github.io/).

🌱 I’m currently learning testing automation using Testng, [Selenium](https://github.com/xJessD/test-automation-practice) and the [Cucumber framework](https://github.com/xJessD/selenium-cucumber)!

❤️ I really enjoy HTML & CSS. And I might be a bit Android biased (hence my [FakeOS](https://xjessd.github.io/fakeOS/) project).
