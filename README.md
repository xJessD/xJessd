## Hi there 👋
I'm Jess! 
I'm currently undertaking an intensive 12 week _nology course. You can view my [portfolio here](https://xjessd.github.io/).


🔭 I’m currently working on a learning management platform for my client project.

🌱 I’m currently learning NestJS & Mikro-Orm!

❤️ I really enjoy HTML & CSS. And I might be a bit Android biased (hence my [FakeOS](https://xjessd.github.io/fakeOS/) project).

💬 Ask me about some anime and manga 📖
