### Hi there 👋
I'm Jess! 
I'm currently undertaking an intensive 12 week nology course. 


🔭 I’m currently working on a _nology React eShop project.

🌱 I’m currently learning Java!

❤️ I really enjoy HTML & CSS. And I might be a bit Android biased (hence my fakeOS project) 

💬 Ask me about some anime and manga 📖
